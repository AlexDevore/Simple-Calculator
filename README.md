# Calculator Application

## Simple Command-Line Calculator

Welcome to the Calculator Application repository! This is a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and exponentiation.

### What This Project Does

This Calculator Application is designed to provide a straightforward interface for performing basic mathematical operations. Users can input two numbers and select an operator to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation. The application runs continuously until the user decides to quit.

## Installation and Usage Instructions (for End-Users)

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this application, you need a C++ compiler installed on your machine. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is commonly used.

### Usage

1. The program will prompt you to enter the first number.
2. Enter the second number.
3. Enter the operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`).

You can quit the application at any point by entering `q`.

#### Example

```bash
Calculator Application
Enter first number (or 'q' to quit): 5
Enter second number (or 'q' to quit): 3
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, ^ or 'q' to quit): +
5 + 3 = 8
```
