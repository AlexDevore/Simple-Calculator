Here's a detailed and structured README for your GitHub repository for the Calculator Application:
Calculator Application

Welcome to the Calculator Application repository! This simple command-line calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and exponentiation.
Features

    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Division (with error handling for division by zero)
    Exponentiation
    Continuous operation until the user decides to quit
    
Usage

    The program will prompt you to enter the first number.
    Enter the second number.
    Enter the operator (+, -, *, /, ^).

You can quit the application at any point by entering q.
Example

bash

Calculator Application
Enter first number (or 'q' to quit): 5
Enter second number (or 'q' to quit): 3
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, ^ or 'q' to quit): +
5 + 3 = 8

Code Overview

The main logic of the calculator is contained within a while loop that continuously prompts the user for input until they choose to quit. The user inputs are taken as strings and converted to floating-point numbers using stof. The switch statement handles the different arithmetic operations, and error handling is provided for division by zero and invalid operators.
